## Differential Privacy
agg + noise
### Why is differential privacy better than DEID?
- DEID is relying on the data $\leftarrow$ correlated with other data
- DP relies on the noise generated by the Lapace mechanism $\leftarrow$ independent of all other data
What it boils down to is in DEID we can remove the uncertainty, in DP this is impossible because the uncertainty is disjoint from the data.
### What does DP promise?
Imagine there is a real world and an ideal world
If $S$ happens in the real world it probably also happens in the ideal world
**Real World**
- I fill out a census card
**Ideal World** (perfect privacy)
- Not fill out the census

/not promise
- define good v.s bad
